## Orbitron

Original Orbitron font downloaded from [fontsquirrel.com](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Orbitron).

The original downloaded font has been retained as "ORIG orbitron-medium.ttf"

Several modifications:
*   all digits are the same width
*   digit '1' modified to have a broader base line, so that it works as a fixed width digit
*	em-size changed from 1000 to 1024 (as recommended by FontForge editor)
*	minor fixes in ccedilla (as recommended by FontForge editor)
*	minor fixed in x-alt, k-alt (as recommended by FontForge editor)
*	caret '^' copied to ascii-caret (was missing)

The modified font has been stored as "Orbitron-Medium.sfd"
and exported as "Orbitron-Medium.ttf".
